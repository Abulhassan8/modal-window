    <h1>Docker</h1>
    <p>
      Docker, a subset of the Moby project, is a software framework for building, running, and managing containers on servers and the cloud. The term "docker" may refer to either the tools (the commands and a daemon) or to the Dockerfile file format.

It used to be that when you wanted to run a web application, you bought a server, installed Linux, set up a LAMP stack, and ran the app. If your app got popular, you practiced good load balancing by setting up a second server to ensure the application wouldn't crash from too much traffic.
